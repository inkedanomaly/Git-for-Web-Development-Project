    Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    An inline element only uses the amount of space needed for the element and the height and width cannot be adjusted. A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. It is then taken out of the flow and other elements are positioned as if it did not exist.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    By using the display: inline-block element the the width can be assigned and the element will only take up the amount of space it needs.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    3 display block elements by default are the <div> element, the <header> element, and <h1>-<h6>.
    2 display inline elements by default are <img> and <a>.
    1 element that is display inline-block by default is <button>


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
